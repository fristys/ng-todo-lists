# Front-end task for Spiir by Momchil Georgiev

## Todo list overview

- Creating a new list should add a new item to list of todo lists
  - Creating a new item is done by entering a title in input field and hitting `enter`
  - It should not be possible to create a list without a `title`

- The todo list item should have a label specifying how many todos are left to do
  - If there are no todos in the list, show `0 todos`
  - If there are todos in the list, show how many are yet to be completed
  - If all todos in the list have been completed, show `‚ÄúAll done!üöÄ‚Äù`

- Clicking an item in list of todo lists should route to item

## Todo list

- Header + HTML Doc title must show title of todo list

- Todos should be sorted by completion, then created date, meaning completed todos should appear at top when shown, and todos should be sorted so that oldest todos are first in list

- It should be possible to toggle whether completed todos are shown or not
